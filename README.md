# Musical Attribute Analysis: What makes up my musical taste?

I have always been passionate about music and an avid music listener from a young age. I will be focusing this analysis to answer the following question: **"What makes up my musical taste?"**

In order to answer this question, I will be analyzing Audio Features of every song I listen to by utilizing the Spotify API. I have explained the Data Collection, Preprocessing, Analysis and Vizualization process in detail below.

This first [notebook](https://github.com/sreegp/Musical-Attribute-Analysis/blob/master/Musical%20Attribute%20Analysis%20-%20Data%20Collection%20%26%20Preprocessing.ipynb) focuses on Data Collection & Preprocessing, and second [notebook](https://github.com/sreegp/Musical-Attribute-Analysis/blob/master/Musical%20Attribute%20Analysis%20-%20Data%20Analysis%20%26%20Visualization.ipynb) focuses on Data Analysis and Vizualization. 

## What makes up my musical taste?
• Based on the mean and dispersion of the musical features, I enjoy loud, recorded
(not live) music that contains very little speech.

• Wide Variety: I listen to songs in three different languages (English, Hindi, Tamil),
with songs spanning the full Acoustic and Instrumental spectrum.

• Clear Favorites: I frequently (>120/year) listen to a small (<20) selection of songs.

## Future Analysis:
• How does my musical taste compare with popular taste? (Spotify’s Top 100 Songs)

• Across languages, which artists’ music sound similar?

• Of all new song releases, which new songs should I listen to next?
